\begin{problem}
    Let $A$ be a non-local ring.
    Prove that the $A$-module $A$ has two minimal systems of generators with a different number of generators.
    \begin{sol}
        \begin{proof}
            Trivially, $S_1 = \langle1\rangle$ is a minimal $A$-system of generators of $A$.
            Since $A$ is non-local, there exist $\mathfrak{m}$ and $\mathfrak{n} \in Max(A)$ with minimal systems of
            generators $S_\mathfrak{m}$ and $S_\mathfrak{n}$ respectively.
            Since they are maximal ideals, $\mathfrak{m} + \mathfrak{n} = A$ and $S_\mathfrak{m} \cup S_\mathfrak{n}$ is a
            system of generators of $A$.
            Now we can take $S_2 \subseteq S_\mathfrak{m} \cup S_\mathfrak{n}$ such that $S_2$ is a minimal set of
            generators os $A$.
            Suppose $|S_2| = 1$.
            Then $S_2 = \{x\}$ with $x \in S_\mathfrak{m} \cup S_\mathfrak{n}$.
            But then $x \in S_\mathfrak{m}$ or $x \in S_\mathfrak{n}$, and $A = \mathfrak{m}$ or $A = \mathfrak{n}$, in
            contradiction with $\mathfrak{m}$ and $\mathfrak{n}$ being prime ideals.
            $S_1$ and $S_2$ are minimal systems of generators of $A$ with $1 = |S_1| \neq |S_2| > 1$.
        \end{proof}
    \end{sol}
