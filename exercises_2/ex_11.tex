\begin{problem}
    Let $M$ be an $A$-module and let $N_1$, $N_2$ be submodules of $M$.
    Prove that if $M/N_1$ and $M/N_2$ are Noetherian (Artinian) then $M/(N_1 \cap N_2)$ is Noetherian (Artinian) as well.
    \begin{sol}
        \begin{proof}
            Consider the sequence
            \[ \label{equation:1} \tag{1}
                0 \longrightarrow \sfrac{N_1}{N_1 \cap N_2} \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
                \sfrac{M}{N_1 \cap N_2}
                \overset{g}{\longrightarrow}
                \sfrac{(\sfrac{M}{N_1 \cap N_2})}{(\sfrac{N_1}{N_1 \cap N_2})}
                \longrightarrow 0
            \]
            where $f$ is the inclusion and $g$ is the projection.
            By definition of inclusion and projection, $f$ is injective and $g$ is exhaustive.
            It is clear that $\text{Im}(f) = \sfrac{N_1}{N_1 \cap N_2} = \ker(g)$.
            so~\eqref{equation:1} is a short exact sequence.
            Now, we know that $\sfrac{N_1}{N_1 \cap N_2} \cong \sfrac{(N_1 + N_2)}{N_2} \subseteq \sfrac{M}{N_2}$.
            Submodules of Noetherian (Artinian) modules are Noetherian (Artinian),
            and thus $\sfrac{N_1}{N_1 \cap N_2}$ is Noetherian (Artinian).
            Also, $\sfrac{(\sfrac{M}{N_1 \cap N_2})}{(\sfrac{N_1}{N_1 \cap N_2})} \cong \sfrac{M}{N_1}$ is Noetherian (Artinian).
            By a proposition we proved in class, we can conclude that $M/(N_1 \cap N_2)$, the module in the middle of the short exact sequence,
            is Noetherian (Artinian).
        \end{proof}
