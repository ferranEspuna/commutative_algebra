\begin{problem}
    \textbf{Nakayama's lemma.} Let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module and $I$ an ideal of $A$ contained in the
    Jacobson radical.
    Prove:
    \[
        IM = M \Rightarrow M = 0
    \]
    \begin{sol}
        \begin{proof}
            Consider $\{m_1, \dots, m_n\}$ a minimal set of generators of $M$ with $n > 0$.
            Since $M = IM$, $m_1 \in IM$, and there exist $a_1, \dots, a_n \in I$ such that
            \[
                m_1 = a_1 m_1 + a_2 m_2 + \dots + a_n m_n
            \]
            or, grouping the $m_1$s
            \[
                0 = (a_1 - 1) m_1 + a_2 m_2 + \dots + a_n m_n
            \]
            Now, exercise 3.1 from list 1 tells us that, since $a_1 \in I \subseteq \mathcal{J}(A)$, $1 - a_1$ is
            invertible, and $a_1 - 1$ is invertible too.
            Then,
            \[
                (a_1 - 1)^{-1}((a_1 - 1) m_1 + a_2 m_2 + \dots + a_n m_n) = 0
            \]
            and
            \[
                m_1 = -(a_1 - 1)^{-1} a_2 m_2 - \dots - (a_1 - 1)^{-1} a_n m_n
            \]
            This is a contradiction with the minimality of the set of generators.
            We conclude that $n = 0$ and thus $M = 0$.
        \end{proof}
    \end{sol}
