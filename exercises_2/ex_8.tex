\begin{problem}
    Let $A$ be a ring, $M$, $N$ finitely generated $A$-modules.
    Prove:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\theproblem.\arabic*),ref=\theproblem.\arabic*]
        \item $M \otimes_A N$ is a finitely generated $A$-module.
            \begin{sol}
                \begin{proof}
                    Take $\{m_1, \dots, m_k\}$ and $\{n_1, \dots, n_p\}$ finite systems of generators of $M$ and $N$ respectively.
                    We have seen that a construction of $M \otimes_A N$ is $F/R$ with
                    \[ F = \bigoplus_{(m,n) \in M \times N} A e(m,n)\]
                    where each $A e(m,n)$ is a free $A$-module of rank $1$ and $R$ is the set of bilinear relationships of between them.

                    Now, for all $m \in M$ and $n \in N$ exist $a_1, \dots, a_k, b_1, \dots, b_p \in A$ such that \linebreak
                    ${m = a_1 m_1 + \dots + a_k m_k}$
                    and ${n = b_1 n_1 + \dots + b_p n_p}$.
                    Then
                    \[
                       \overline{e(m,n)} = \overline{e(a_1 m_1 + \dots + a_k m_k, b_1 n_1 + \dots + b_p n_p)}
                       = \sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{p} a_i b_j \overline{e(m_i, n_j)}
                    \]
                    We conclude that $\{\overline{e(m_i, n_j)}\mid 1 \leq i \leq k, 1 \leq j \leq p\}$
                    is a finite system of generators of $M \otimes_A N$,
                    and $M \otimes_A N$ is a finitely generated $A$-module.
                \end{proof}
            \end{sol}
        \item If $A$ is Noetherian, then $Hom_A(M,N)$ is a finitely generated $A$-module.
            \begin{sol}
                \begin{proof}
                    Consider the same system of generators of the previous section for $M$ and $N$, and the $A$-module homomorphism
                    \begin{align*}
                        \psi\colon Hom_A(M,N) &\to N^r \\
                        (f: M \rightarrow N) &\mapsto (f(m_1), \dots, f(m_r))
                    \end{align*}
                    Suppose that $\psi(f) = \psi(g)$.
                    Then $f(m_i) = g(m_i)$ for all $i \in \{1, \dots, r\}$.
                    For all $m \in M$ there exist $a_1, \dots, a_k \in A$ such that $m = a_1 m_1 + \dots + a_k m_k$, and
                    \[
                        f(m) = f(a_1 m_1 + \dots + a_k m_k) = \sum_{i=1}^{r} a_i f(m_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{r} a_i g(m_i) = g(a_1 m_1 + \dots + a_k m_k) = g(m)
                    \]
                    Thus, $f = g$ and $\psi$ is injective.

                    Then, $Hom_A(M,N) \cong \psi(Hom_A(M,N)) \subseteq N^r$ with $N^r$
                    being a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring, and thus Noetherian itself.
                    Since submodules of Noetherian modules are Noetherian, $Hom_A(M,N)$ is Noetherian too,
                    and we conclude that it is finitely generated.

                \end{proof}
            \end{sol}
    \end{enumerate}
