\begin{problem}
Describe $\text{spec}(\mathbb{Z}[T])$
\begin{sol}
    Suppose that $\mathfrak{p} \subset \mathbb{Z}[T]$ is an ideal.
    We will distinguish three cases:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\mathfrak{p} = $\textcolor{blue}{$(0)$}
        is a prime ideal of $\mathbb{Z}[T]$ since $\mathbb{Z}[T]$ is an integral domain.
        \item $\mathfrak{p} = (f)$ is a principal ideal generated by a non-zero polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[T]$.
        There are two possibilities:
        \begin{itemize}

            \item $\deg f = 0 \Leftrightarrow f = n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
            Suppose $(n)$ is a prime ideal.
            In this case, it is clear by the inclusion $\varphi:\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}[T]$ that $(n) = (n)^c$ is prime in $\mathbb{Z}$.
            Conversely, let $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ be a prime number. $\mathbb{Z}[T]/(p) \cong \mathbb{Z}/(p)[T]$
            is an integral domain since $\mathbb{Z}/(p)$ is a field (in particular, an integral domain).
            We obtain the ideals
            \[
                 \textcolor{blue}{(p) \text{ where } p \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ is prime}}
            \]
            \item $\deg f > 0$.
            \begin{claim}
                $(f)$ is prime $\Rightarrow f$ is primitive.
                \begin{proof}
                    Otherwise, there is some non-unit $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ that divides all coefficients of $f$.
                    Then $f = pg$ for some $g \in \mathbb{Z}[T]$, which is a non-trivial factorization of $f$.
                    $f$ is not irreducible, so it is not prime (since $\mathbb{Z}$ is a domain).
                \end{proof}
            \end{claim}
            \begin{claim}
                $(f)$ is prime $\Rightarrow f$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[T]$.
                \begin{proof}
                    Suppose $f = gh$ is a non-trivial factorization, for some $g,h \in \mathbb{Q}[T]$ (in particular, since all non-zero elements of $\mathbb{Q}$ are units, $\deg g, \deg h > 0 \Rightarrow \deg g, \deg h < \deg f$).
                    Taking a common denominator $n$ and multiplying by it, we obtain $nf = \tilde{g}\tilde{h}$ in $\mathbb{Z}[T]$.
                    By the left side, this belongs to $(f)$, but $\tilde{g}, \tilde{h}$ do not belong to $(f)$ since they have strictly smaller degree than $f$.
                \end{proof}
            \end{claim}

            \begin{claim}
                These conditions are also sufficient: if $f$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[T]$ and primitive, then $(f)$ is prime.
                \begin{proof}
                    Consider the natural inclusion $\phi:\mathbb{Z}[T] \to \mathbb{Q}[T]$.
                    We will extend and then contract the ideal $(f)$ of $\mathbb{Z}[T]$.
                    By taking a common denominator and factors:
                    \[(f)^{ec} = \mathbb{Z} \cap (f)_{\mathbb{Q}} = \mathbb{Z}[T] \cap \left\{\frac{n}{m}fh \mid n, m \in \mathbb{Z}, h \in \mathbb{Z}[T] \, \text{primitive}\right\}\]
                    We know that $(f) \subset (f)^{ec}$.
                    We will prove the other inclusion and therefore equality.
                    Indeed, take $g = \frac{n}{m}fh \in (f)^{ec}$ of the form described above.
                    For any prime $p \mid m$, we have shown that $(p)$ is prime in $\mathbb{Z}[T]$.
                    Furthermore, $f, h$ are primitive, so $p$ does not divide them $\Rightarrow p \mid n$.
                    We can cancel $p$ in the fraction, and repeat the process for all prime factors of $m$. 
                    Therefore, $g \in (f)_{\mathbb{Z}}$.
                    Now, as $f$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[T]$, which is a P.I.D, $(f)_{\mathbb{Q}} = (f)_{\mathbb{Z}}^e$ is prime in $\mathbb{Q}[T]$.
                    Therefore, so is $(f) = (f)^{ec} \subset \mathbb{Z}[T]$.
                \end{proof}
            \end{claim}
            With all these claims, this case yields ideals of the form
                \[
                    \textcolor{blue}{(f) \text{ where } f \in \mathbb{Z}[T] \text{ is irreducible and primitive}}
                \]
        \end{itemize}
        \item $\mathfrak{p}$ is not principal.
        \begin{claim} $\mathfrak{p}$ prime $\Rightarrow p \in \mathfrak{p}$ for some $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ prime.
            \begin{proof}
                Suppose not.
                Then, $\mathfrak{p}$ contains no prime number.
                All its elements are multiples of $T$.
                Its extension to $\mathbb{Q}[T]$ must be a principal ideal generated by a multiple of $T$ (say, $\hat{g}(T) = a_k T^k + \cdots + a_m T^m$).
                Contracting back to $\mathbb{Z}[T]$, we obtain a principal ideal $(g)$, ($g$ is an appropriate multiple of $\hat{g}$ with coprime integer coefficients).
                We know that $(g) \subset \mathfrak{p}$, but $\mathfrak{p}$ is not principal, so we don't have equality.
                There exists some nonzero $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $ng \in \mathfrak{p}$.
                Since $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime, $n \in \mathfrak{p}$.
                However, taking the prime factorization of $n$, we can show by induction on the number of primes that $\mathfrak{p}$ contains a prime number.
                Indeed:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item If $n$ is prime, we are done.
                    \item If $n = ap$ with $p$ prime, either $p \in \mathfrak{p}$ or $a \in \mathfrak{p}$, reducing the number of primes.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{proof}
        \end{claim}

        There is a known bijection between the ideals of $A$ containing an ideal $I$ and the ideals of $A/I$, given by extension and contraction.
        That is, extending and contracting yields the same ideal.
        This bijection is also true if we impose that the ideals be prime, because the contraction of a prime ideal is prime.
        If we apply this to $(p) \subset \mathbb{Z}[T]$,
        because $\mathbb{Z}[T]/(p) = \mathbb{Z}/(p)[T]$ is a P.I.D,
        it only contains prime ideals of the form $(g)$ where $g \in \mathbb{Z}/(p)$ is irreducible.
        Furthermore, because $\mathbb{Z}/(p)$ is a field, we may take $g$ to be monic.
        we have that the prime ideals of $\mathbb{Z}[T]$ containing $(p)$ are of the form
        \[
            \textcolor{blue}{(p, g) \text{ where } g \text{ is monic and irreducible in } \mathbb{Z}/(p)[T]}
        \]

    \end{enumerate}
